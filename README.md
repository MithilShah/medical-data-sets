A curated list of medical data sets that can be used for research


## MIMIC IV
MIMIC-IV is a relational database containing real hospital stays for patients admitted to a tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA, USA. MIMIC-IV contains comprehensive information for each patient while they were in the hospital: laboratory measurements, medications administered, vital signs documented, and so on. The database is intended to support a wide variety of research in healthcare. MIMIC-IV builds upon the success of MIMIC-III, and incorporates numerous improvements over MIMIC-III.
