A curated list of medical data sets that can be used for research


## MIMIC IV
MIMIC-IV is a relational database containing real hospital stays for patients admitted to a tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA, USA. MIMIC-IV contains comprehensive information for each patient while they were in the hospital: laboratory measurements, medications administered, vital signs documented, and so on. The database is intended to support a wide variety of research in healthcare. MIMIC-IV builds upon the success of MIMIC-III, and incorporates numerous improvements over MIMIC-III.

To get access to data you need to first have a credentialed physionet account https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/. The first step in credentialing is to complete this training here - https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/

## CADEC
https://researchdata.edu.au/cadec/494923  
CSIRO Adverse Drug Event Corpus (Cadec) is a rich annotated corpus of medical forum posts on patient reported Adverse Drug Events (ADEs). This corpus is useful for those studies in the area of information extraction, or more generically text mining, from social media to detect possible adverse drug reactions from direct patient reports.

## Deidentified Medical Text - Physionet
https://physionet.org/content/deidentifiedmedicaltext/1.0/  
a gold standard corpus of 2,434 nursing notes that have been thoroughly deidentified by a multi-pass process that included meticulous reviews by three or more experts working independently, as well as by a variety of automated methods. All detected instances of PHI in these nursing notes have been replaced by realistic surrogate data. The gold standard corpus is currently available only to those who have been granted access to PhysioNet Clinical Databases.

## PrevComp_Corpus  
https://www.kaggle.com/nohaalnazzawi/prevcomp-corpus  
The PrevComp corpus consists of two document types: 274 Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and 2,265 tweets. 
The EHRs are a subset of the i2b2 heart risk factor EHRs challenge. This repository includes the stand-off annotations for the EHRs and tweets. It also includes the TweetIDs of the the tweets that were obtained from twitter. The full-text of EHRs subset of the corpus  is protected by the i2b2 and you would have to obtain the license to be able to have a copy of the original text records. 

## SNOMED CT International Edition  
https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/international.html  
SNOMED CT terminology provides a common language that enables a consistent way of indexing, storing, retrieving, and aggregating clinical data across specialties and sites of care. The release notes provide a summarized description of the content changes.

## Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)  
https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html  

The UMLS integrates and distributes key terminology, classification and coding standards, and associated resources to promote creation of more effective and interoperable biomedical information systems and services, including electronic health records.

## MedNLI  
https://physionet.org/content/mednli/1.0.0/  
a dataset annotated by doctors, performing a natural language inference task (NLI), grounded in the medical history of patients. As the source of premise sentences, they used the MIMIC-III.

## BC5CDR Corpus  
https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/media/store/files/2015/BC5CDRcorpus.pdf  

1,500 PubMed articles with 4,409 annotated chemicals, 5,818 diseases, and 3,116 chemical-disease interactions. Each annotation includes both the mention text spans
and normalized concept identifiers (MeSH was used as the controlled vocabulary)
